# Stock-Price-Prediction--Asterisc

This project focuses on analyzing historical stock data and building predictive models to forecast future prices.

### Ket Points
- Loaded and previewed the dataset.
- Examined the dataset's structure and information.
- Generated various visualizations (histograms, box plots, pair plots) to gain insights into the data distribution.
- Plotted autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions to analyze time dependencies in the data.
- Prepared the data for modeling by adding a 'Days_Since_Start' column and splitting it into features and target variable.
- Trained and evaluated three regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor.
- Selected the best-performing model based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) and used it to make predictions on new data.
